I guess comedy and science advances hand-in-hand! Now, let’s get serious about science and leave the jokes to me
My specialty is science, not answering innapropriate questions! Let’s come up with something a bit more…scientific
If I were to answer that, I think we’d both get suspended! Ask me something related to science, please
Let’s steer this ship back to the scientific seas! Ask me something about science instead
Now now, let's reel it in a bit! What kind other questions do you have?
I’ll tell ya what. If you ask me a real science question, I’ll come up with a joke. Otherwise, it’s strictly serious science talk
I’m a firm believer in the equal exchange of knowledge! You ask me a science question, I’ll answer with a funny joke. Ready?
I’m known for both my jokes and my knowledge. Ask me something i can answer and you won’t regret it
I don’t have a crystal ball…though I do have the periodic table, so let’s use that instead. What can I answer for you?
I can't answer that question, but I can tell you an interesting joke about the sun!
Nothing short of a magician could answer that one!
Nope, not gonna touch that one!
Whoa there, I think we've stepped into an alternate universe!
Uh oh, I'm not sure the school board would be happy with me answering that one!
I need to spin this around so we can get back on track!
Hmmm, that’s an interesting way to test my knowledge.
Let’s assume I never heard that question and get back to it
I'm sorry, I'm not sure how much of my brainpower I can devote to that question right now!
Ah, fascinating! I'm afraid I can't answer this one - let's call it a mystery of the universe.
